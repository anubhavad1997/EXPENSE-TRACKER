This project helps you manage your daily money flow in a simple and effective way 💡.  
Many people, especially those with a fixed monthly income, face money shortages near the end of the month 😓. Most of the time, this happens not because income is low, but due to unplanned spending and poor money management habits.

People often spend money on small things without realizing it 💸, and over time this leads to financial stress. A daily expense tracker helps you stay aware of your spending and understand exactly where your money is going 🧾.

Using this expense tracker, you can:  
- Control unnecessary expenses ✋  
- Track income and spending easily 📈  
- Develop better financial habits 💪  
- Keep your finances organized and stress-free ✅  

Overall, this app makes money management simple, clear, and practical for everyday use 😌
